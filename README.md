## VarNote
   VarNote is a tool that rapidly annotates genome-scale variants from large and complex functional annotation resources. It supports both region-based and allele-specific annotations for different file formats and introduces many advanced functions to improve the flexibility. For more information and usage of VarNote, please visit http://mulinlab.org/varnote.
